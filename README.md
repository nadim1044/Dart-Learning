# Dart Learning

This repo is going to talk about the basic of dart language

## Abstract class

Abstract class is used in Object orineted programmig language for abstraction and encapsulation.

Points:

- abstract keyword used for abstract class.
- abstract class can run without abstract method.
- you can add concrete method on abstraction class.
- Abstract classes can't be instantiated.

Example:

abstract class Person is having abstract method `personIntro`. Which can be vary person to person and `displayInfo` can
be concrete method for all Person.

`person.dart`

```dart
abstract class Person {

  Person({required this.name});

  String name;

  void personIntro();

  void displayInfo() {
    print('Name : $name');
  }
}

```

`boy.dart`

```dart
class Boy extends Person {
  Boy({required super.name});

  @override
  void personIntro() {
    print('My name is $name. I am a engineer');
  }

}
```

## Sealed class

A sealed class acts like a 'locked' or restricted class hierarchy, where all subclasses must be defined in the same
file. This restriction creates a controlled set of subclasses, effectively 'locking' the class against any further
extension outside of the defined scope.

As Example: Think you have class called result in which you just want to have finit set of outcomes that can be Success
and Failed.

sealed class also enables a pattern matching in dart for switch cases.

## Final and const keyword

### final with variables

It is going throw exception on reinitialization.

It is used when you want to evaluated of your variable at run-time.

Example : `DateTime.now();`

### const with variables

It is used when you want to evaluated of your variable at compile-time.

So using we can variable const if know its value before compilation and don't want to reinitialize it.

### final with class

- if you make class final then it would not be available for any further extension.

## Static

- Static keyword is use with variable and method
- It is used for memory management
- variable and method belongs class instead of instance.
- Dart does not have feature of static bloc and static nested class like java.
- You can use static variable only in static method bloc.

```dart
class Student {
  Student({required this.name});

  String name;
  static String collegeName = '';

  static void changeCollegeName() {
    collegeName = 'IIT-Delhi';
  }
}
```

## Private Named and const Constructor

- This is used make singleton object in dart.
- Since dart is not having any object keyword for singleton object creation it creates singleton object through making
  constructor private.
- After making constructor private it will not be allowed to create its instance out side of the class.
- if you add name after underscore it will become Named private constructor.

Example:

```dart
class Singleton {
  static Singleton? _instance; // Private instance variable

  // Private constructor
  Singleton._();

  // Factory constructor to provide access to the singleton instance
  factory Singleton.getInstance() {
    if (_instance == null) {
      _instance = Singleton._(); // Creating an instance using the private constructor
    }
    return _instance!;
  }
}
```

## Parameters in Dart

- There are mainly three types of parameters exist in dart.
- after this there are two combination is `positionalParamsWithNamed` and `positionalParamsWithOptional`.
- Positional params: every arguments need to be in actual when you are providing its value.
- Named params: every arguments gets the name as and need to provide value accordingly. Use curly brace.
- Optional params: arguments will be optional to provide its value. uses square brackets.

#### Example:

```dart
static void namedParams
(
{
required
String
name}) {
print('Named Params : $name');
}

static void optionalParams([String? name]) {
print('optionalParams : $name');
}

static void positionalParams(String? name) {
print('positionalParams : $name');
}

static void positionalParamsWithNamed(String name, {required String title}) {
print('positionalParamsWithNamed : $name : $title');
}

static void positionalParamsWithOptional(String name, [String? title]) {
print('positionalParamsWithOptional : $name : $title');
}
```

## Enums

- Enums are uses for named constant value in dart.
- Enums provides constant, and you can add your desire object with it.
- As example, you can create country code enums and provide actual name of country with it.

```dart
enum Country {
  INDIA('India'),
  CANADA('Canada'),
  IRELAND('Ireland'),
  CHINA('China');

  const Country(this.countryName);

  final String countryName;
}
```
